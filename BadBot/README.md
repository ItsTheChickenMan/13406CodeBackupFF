# BadBot

Code for our original 18x18 bot.  It was pretty bad: it slowly picked up freight and needed to be aligned fairly perfectly in order to work.  The code for this was pretty terrible as well, as this was my first bot I ever programmed.

Each folder contains EVERY source file present within the bot at that point in time.  I never deleted any of the excess code that was already on the hub, so here are the only files ever used by this bot in competition:

- PhoenixAutoBlueDuck.java
- PhoenixAutoRedDuck.java
- PhoenixAutoBlueWarehouse.java
- PhoenixAutoRedWarehouse.java
- EzrasLaw.java, main bot class
- WinningOpMode.java, main teleop class

In general, the code is poorly documented and poorly written.
