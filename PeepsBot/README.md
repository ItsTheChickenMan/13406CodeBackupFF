# PeepsBot

Code for our MA State Champs bot: PeepsBot.  Named after our captain's cat: Peeps.  We called it PeepsBot because we spent a lot of February break building this bot at the captain's house, where we ended up wasting a lot of time messing with his cat.  He actually has two cats, but the other one doesn't like us.

This bot was a lot more complicated.  As a result, I cut out a lot of bloat from the bot class, EzrasLaw, as well as rewrote a lot of methods and documented everything.  This only shows in the later backup I made in March, though.  In fact, the 2.15.2022 backup can be completely ignored, the March backup is the code we brought to comp.

Each folder contains EVERY source file present within the bot at that point in time.  I never deleted any of the excess code that was already on the hub, so here are the only files ever used by this bot in competition:

- PhoenixAutoBlueDuck.java \*
- PhoenixAutoRedDuck.java \*
- PhoenixAutoBlueWarehouse.java
- PhoenixAutoRedWarehouse.java
- EzrasLaw.java, main bot class
- WinningOpModeBlue.java, main teleop class for blue alliance
- WinningOpModeRed.java, main teleop class for red alliance

\* those who competed with us may remember that we had no duck side auto for most of comp.  I wrote these autos throughout the day in whatever free time we had before matches.  I had them done by the playoffs, but we never used them.
